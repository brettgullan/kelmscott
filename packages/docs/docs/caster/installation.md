title: Installation
---

Caster is designed to be as light-weight as possible, and integrates with an existing front-end build environment. It requires some additional libraries to be installed with it.

```shell
$ npm i ramda ramda-adunct traverse @kelmscott/caster
```

```shell
$ yarn add ramda ramda-adunct traverse @kelmscott/caster
```
